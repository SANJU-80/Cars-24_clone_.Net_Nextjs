## 🧮 **Pricing Algorithm**

### **1. Base Price Analysis**
```csharp
// Starting point: Seller's listed price
decimal basePrice = request.BasePrice;
```

### **2. Multi-Factor Adjustments**
The system applies 10 weighted adjustment factors:

#### **A. Regional Adjustments (Weight: 1.2)**
```csharp
// City-specific economic multipliers
Mumbai: 1.08x (High economic activity)
Delhi: 1.06x (Metro premium)
Bangalore: 1.04x (Tech hub)
Chennai: 1.00x (Standard)
```

#### **B. Seasonal Adjustments (Weight: 1.1)**
```csharp
// Vehicle type seasonal demand
Monsoon: SUV +15%, Hatchback -8%
Summer: Electric +10%, Sedan +2%
Winter: Luxury +5%, All types stable
Spring: Festival season +8% across types
```

#### **C. Vehicle Type Adjustments (Weight: 1.0)**
```csharp
// Current market demand
SUV: High demand +10%
Electric: Growing interest +12%
Hatchback: Fuel efficiency preference +5%
Luxury: Stable demand +3%
```

#### **D. Economic Factors (Weight: 0.8)**
```csharp
// Regional economic conditions
Metro cities: +5% premium
Tier-2 cities: Standard pricing
Rural areas: -2% adjustment
```

#### **E. Fuel Price Impact (Weight: 0.9)**
```csharp
// Fuel price sensitivity
Electric: +5% (fuel price spikes)
Hatchback: -3% (efficiency advantage)
SUV Diesel: -2% (fuel cost impact)
```

#### **F. Mileage Impact (Weight: 1.3)**
```csharp
// Mileage vs age analysis
High mileage (>20k/year): -5% penalty
Low mileage (<12k/year): +3% bonus
Normal mileage: No adjustment
```

#### **G. Age Impact (Weight: 1.4)**
```csharp
// Depreciation curve
0-1 years: 0% (New car)
2-3 years: -2% (Slight depreciation)
4-5 years: -5% (Moderate depreciation)
6-8 years: -8% (Higher depreciation)
9+ years: -12% (Significant depreciation)
```

#### **H. Condition Impact (Weight: 1.5)**
```csharp
// Vehicle condition multipliers
Excellent: +5% premium
Good: 0% (Baseline)
Fair: -8% adjustment
Poor: -15% penalty
```

#### **I. Brand Popularity (Weight: 0.7)**
```csharp
// Regional brand preferences
Maruti: Universal popularity +2%
Hyundai: Metro preference +1%
Toyota: Bangalore premium +3%
BMW/Mercedes: Luxury metro +5%
```

#### **J. Supply/Demand (Weight: 1.1)**
```csharp
// Market dynamics
High demand: +5% adjustment
Balanced: No change
Oversupply: -3% adjustment
```

### **3. Final Price Calculation**
```csharp
// Weighted average of all adjustments
decimal totalAdjustment = weightedSum / totalWeight;
decimal recommendedPrice = basePrice * (1 + totalAdjustment / 100);

// Price range calculation
decimal volatility = Math.Abs(totalAdjustment) / 10;
decimal minPrice = recommendedPrice * (1 - volatility / 100);
decimal maxPrice = recommendedPrice * (1 + volatility / 100);
```
